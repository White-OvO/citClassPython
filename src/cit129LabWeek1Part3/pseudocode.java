/*For your answers below, just state the line number. If none, write N/A.
a. What are the input statements?

Ans: 

there are no inputs

b. What are the output statements?

Ans:

The number we are add in this case
Num1 and Num2


c. What are the assignment statements?
the assignment statments are num2 = num1 + num2

set Num1 = 5
Set Num1 = Num1 + 3
Set Num2 = 5
Num2 = Num1 + Num2
Set Num1 = 10 

d. What number is displayed by this pseudocode? Here, I need the value that will be displayed.
Ans: 
values  
num1 which is 10 
also
 num2 which is 13
